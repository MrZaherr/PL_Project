STAR language is a small scripting language that can be used for performing basic arithmetical operations. It supports only two data types: integers and strings. Integers can only take positive values and would take the value zero when forced to take a negative value. Assignments in STAR can have arithmetic expressions with two, operands only. Complicated expressions are not allowed.

1st Project Defn: The Program should accept a source file called code.sta and produce a text file named as code.lex that contains all the tokens listed one after the other.
Example: The line 
c is c/2.
Would produce:
Identifier(c)
Keyword(is)
Identifier(c)
Operator(/)
EndOfLine
